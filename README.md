# NextGen Food Court Web Application

## Project Overview

**Client:** Nextgen Mall, Nairobi  
**Location:** Mombasa Road, near Central Business District  

A modern web application designed to digitize the food ordering process at Nextgen Mall's food court, which hosts 20-30 outlets serving diverse cuisines including Ethiopian, Nigerian, Congolese, and Kenyan food.

## Problem Statement

Nextgen Mall attracts thousands of daily visitors to its food court. The current ordering system creates confusion as waiters from multiple outlets simultaneously approach customers with numerous menus, often leading to unintended orders. This application streamlines the experience by allowing customers to browse menus and place orders digitally from their table or in advance.
